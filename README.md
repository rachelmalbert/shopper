# Instacart Shopper Wage Calculator

---

### Overview

This repository contains a full-stack web application with a **FastAPI** backend and a **React** frontend. The backend is managed using **Poetry** for Python dependency management, and the frontend is built with **React**.

### Purpose

This tool helps **Instacart shoppers** estimate their pay for orders before accepting them. By entering order details like distance, items, and delivery time, shoppers can make more informed decisions about which orders to accept.

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Activate the Poetry virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   This will run the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3. Set up the frontend (React)
